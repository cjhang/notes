# Reading tips
To make the long note more orgnized and render the math formular propertly, two plugins for Chrome based brower can be helpful:
- [MathJax Plugin for Github](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mathjax-plugin-for-github/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima)
- [Github Toc](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-toc/nalkpgbfaadkpckoadhlkihofnbhfhek?hl=en)

For the desktop user, [Typora](https://typora.io/) can be the ideal markdown reader to render all the notes(including math formular, toc and diagrams)
