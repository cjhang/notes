# The detecting methods

### Direct methods

Direct imaging:

- high-contrast, hot-jupiter and observation in IR band would be favoured
- reserved for large, young planets far from the star
- completemented by the observation of large dust gas

Disc fingerprint: velocity

- The deviation of the accretion disk from regular Keplerian motion

### Indirect methods

Transit

- Transmission spectrum: limb darkening 
- Favor small orbits around large star
- Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect, the rotaional stars make transmission along with blueshift/redshift of spectrum of the stars
- Transit-Timing variations, gravitional interactions between planets to speed up/ slow down the orbital motion

Radial velocity

- Tricky with the inclination of the rotational system

Micro-lensing

- The spikes in micro-lensing signal

Pulser Timing

- High-accurate of the pulsar system, possible to detect planet as small as earth, the discovery of the first exoplanet

Astromotry

- high-accurate orbit data, small perturbation caused by explanet.
