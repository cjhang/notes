Because the Q and U images both describe the amount of linear  polarization, it is more common to work with a linear polarization  intensity image, $$𝑃=\sqrt{𝑄^2+𝑈^2}$$. We can also calculate the polarization position angle $$𝜒=0.5 \times arc𝑡𝑎𝑛(𝑈/𝑄)$$.

  it is also possible to form the fractional linear polarization image, defined as P/I.
