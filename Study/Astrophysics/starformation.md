There are several ways to calculate the star formation rate (SFR). Good reviews are Kennicutt (1998), Kennicutt (2012)

From shorter wavelength to longer wavelength:

X-ray: The prominent x-ray source include AGN accretion disk, X-ray binary, supernova, supernova remnant and missive stars. Except the AGN contribution, the x-ray can be calibrated with known binary fraction, thus it can also used as SFR tracer of yong stars, average in 0-100 Myr.



UV: uv continuum luminosity mainly contributed by the main sequence stars larger than 5 Msun. So it directly correlates the recent star formation rates. Far UV from the 1500~2000 Å, sensitive to <100 Myr star formation activity and NUV centered at 2300 Å sensitive to <200 Myr stars formation activity. The most striking weakness of UV is the they are heavily suffer from dust extinction and scattering.



H𝛼:  Ha are mainly produced short-lived massive star (1-10 Myr). In order to produce Ha and other hydrogen recombination lines, it needs to totally ionize the hydrogen atom. The bond energy of Hydrogen is 13.6 eV which approximate effective temperature about 10^5^ K. So that only O, B stars, typically with stellar mass larger than 15 Msun (peak contribution from 30-40 Msun). There are also some caveats to use Ha as the SFR indicator:

1. It should be used with dust correction. So it should be careful when studying the dusty galaxy. 
2. The spatial variation should be considered. Lower angular resolution will tend to underestimate the SFR. When average the dust correction over a large region, the less extinct region will contribute a higher weights.
3. It may not work properly in very low star forming galaxies like dwarf galaxies. The low SFR means one very few O,B stars can be formed, so the deduced SFR has a large temporal fluctuations.

4. From Ha to SFR may suffer from the shape of IMF at it was mainly produced by the massive stars. If there is a depletion of massive star, it will also systematically underestimate the SFR.

Lyman 𝛼 also comes from the hydrogen recombination, it is also much brighter than Ha (8.7 times from Case B recombination) but it suffers from the scape function and ...

Other Balmer lines also theoretically works, but they are much weaker than Ha and vulnerable to the stellar absorption.  

Pa𝛼 (18.75 um) and Pa𝛽 (12.82 um) are also comes from the recombination of hydrogen, so they trace the SRF similar to Ha. But they are far less affected by interstellar dust extinction. From the Grim spectra from HST, the SFR derived from Pa𝛽 are larger than Ha, indicate Ha may sometimes underestimate the extinction. (Cleri et al. 2020)



Forbidden lines: They are not directory correlation with star formation, but reflect the abundance of metal and the ionization state of the gas. But they can also be very strong and unique in some redshift window. So the forbidden lines are also used  as star formation rate tracer if calibrated with Ha and metallicity. 



IR: Half the dust in the Universe is absorbed by dust and remitted in the infrared (IR). The general used indicator is the total infrared luminosity (TIR).  The main heating source in star-forming galaxies come from young massive stars. So the TIR sensitive to the star formation happened in 0-100 Myr with younger star the higher weight (Although UV also sensitive to 0-100 Myr star formation but on average to 10 Myr, but IR on average to 5 Myr). However, some caveats should be counted. This includes the missing unattenuated light from dust free emission and the missing of young stars. Without dust, the starlight will escape the galaxy without contribute the IR emission, thus will make the TIR underestimate the current SFR; while for the red galaxies, the IR especially the FIR will dominated by the old stellar population and the AGN, thus it will make TIR overestimate the total SFR.  Across the IR emission, different band may come from the emission:

- 5~20 𝜇m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)

- ~20 𝜇m main-dust grain population

- ~60 𝜇m small grain heated by the intense star-forming regions



radio: radio band dominated by the free-free (flat spectrum) emission and the synchrotron emission (steeper slope). Free-free emission can be easily operated out and correlate with ionizing luminosity sensitive to SFR averaged over 0-100 Myr.  The synchrotron dominates the lower frequency, produced by charged particle in supernovae. The most used empirical tracer is the luminosity of 1.5GHz





IRX - 𝛽 relation

IRX is the Infrared Exess, defined as *L*~IR~/*L*~UV~ 

𝛽 is the power law slope of  1200 < λ < 3200 Å, descriped $f_λ ∝ λ^{β_{UV}}$

It is used to derive the infared luminosity in high-z galaxies with only rest uv observation avaible

This relation has a large scatter, which may contributed by the intrinsic scatter of uv spectral slope
