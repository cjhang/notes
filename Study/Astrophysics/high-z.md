Stream velocity: The relative velocity between the dark matter and the baryons due to the decoupling of baryonic matter and radiation



#### Dust in early galaxies, Da Cunha

Dole+2006, COB+CIB+CMB 

Zavala+2021, obscured SFRD

Popping+2017,  IRX-beta relation

Schouws+2021ï¼Œ rebels pilot survey

Keys  Points:

- Understand the formation of dust at the early Universe
- Multi-band information are essential to tackle down the dust degeneracy (obscuration vs emissitiy)



#### Dust in the EoR

Rebecca Bowler 

- 2017, Size-luminosity relation at z~7
- 2021, UV bright with dust detection, peak position shift between different wavelength (simulation see Cochrane+19)



#### REBELS project - Pascal Oesch

Tackle down the uncertainty in the SFRD in high-z

REBELS:

- 40 UV luminous galaxies, scan for [CII] or [O III] and dust continuum
- significant lower IR luminosity function, but it is based on uv-selected galaxies
- only the result from sub-sample of lumisoity range between 10^11 - 10^12



#### SFRD of high-z galaxies, Carlotta Gruppioni

2020, Based on ALMAPINE survey serendipitous detection, multiband data

SRFD didn't drop up to z~6

Only UV-bright galaxies only play a minor role
