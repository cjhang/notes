 I have something very, very personal to share with you, something that totally changed my life, something that I was really scared of.

I have been struggling with my vision for years and I know that is something that many of you will relate to.

I can now reveal to you I underwent laser eye surgery, but before I recommended anything to you,  I want to make sure that it was actually going to work.

I just did't realize how much I was missing out on before I have my vision sorted 

how much I was missing out, Have my vision sorted

I am going to go through everything 

spoiler alert 剧透警告

For that, I just want to make a couple of things clear

I found it is a fantasitic opportunity to document the process and show you what laser eye surgery is really like. 

I was meant to wear glasses pretty much full time

I start to notice my vision starting to deteriorate in one eye

Astigmatism is your eye shaped more like a rugby ball instead of football, 

so images appear blurred or distorted

The opticians prescribed me glasses

Over time, my vision got much worse and worse 

Dry eye was in the forefront of his mind

I have spent the whole course with my eyes squinting, trying to make out the words

I brough Will with me for support

A global pandemic was in full swing by the time I was going for my appointment
