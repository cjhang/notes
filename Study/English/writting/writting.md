# Academic Writting

## Caveats

1. Don't use contraction: 

   - don't -> do not 

   - can't -> cannot

2. Avoid there is/ there are

   - There are many issues that students face at university -> students face many issues at university

3. Do not use really, very, a lot and so

   - Bill 399 is really controversial -> Bill 399 is controversial

   - a lot of students -> many students

7.  Active voice better than Passive voice(expect science)

5. Use strong verbs

   - He gave assitance to my friend -> He assisted my friends



## Tansitions

### Adding ideas

*In addition (to)*: most common

*Furthermore*: less fomal

*Moreover*: most formal

*Another*: the last choice, the three before is much better, using like 'another reason … '.

> His laziness caused the company to perform badly last quarter. Moreover, his attitude toward the board has put  his job in jeopardy.

They can not only be used to connect two ideas but also be used to link paragraphs. [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/IsDR3XEv50E)

### Transitions within sentences (Academically)

*thereby* : by/through which, due to

*therein*: in that, into that situation/problem/status

*thereafter*: after that

*wherein*: in that, in what way, how (too fomal and too old fasion)

> The company introduced a new incentive program whereby all employees were given an equal shot at the bonuses.

*hereby*: by means

"therefore, thereafter, therein" can be used to begin the sentence while the rest usually cannot used to lead the sentence. All the notes were based on the video of Adam on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/vWQk67meYUA).

### Making Conclusion

*therefore*: from a premise to conclusion, 

*thus*: a result of a last sentence

*consequently*: consequence, start after ;

*so*: more casual

then: very casual

hence: do not use it, try thus

as a result: a little casual

>
> The company, therefore, decided to ... / The company thus decided to ...

> It was too expensive, so …. / It was too expensive; consequently … / It was too expensive, and thus ...
