# Alternatives

This is a collection about all the most frequently used phases in our daily life.

## I think

1. **I believe/feel/consider/reckon[British]**: 

   - I believe that they should have just made space for me in the first place
   - I consider it to be very rude that I forced the side down whenI stood up to make a speech
   - I reckon the sixth gin and tonic tipped me over the edge
   - I feel that my ex could have found a more welcoming bride with a better sense of humor.

2. **I would/I'd say**: I would say that the food was very good, but it was a shame I had to share with my neighbor

   

3. **In my view**[informal], In my view, I should've been invited so it was totally fair for me to turn up on the day.

4. **It is my view/belief that**：It is my view that the open bar made everything worse

5. **From my point of view (formal)**: From my point of view, the first dance was cringe-worth so I did everyone a favor by joining in.

6. **To my mind[formal]**: To my mind, she should've been happier to see me and receive my support. 

7. **To me**: To me, no one knows my ex better than me so I should've been able to tell all of our funny stories.

   

8. **As far as I can tell [(in)formal]/I'm concerned[formal]** : 

   1. As far as I can tell, the bride wasn't really expecting me.
   2. As far as I 'm concerned, she totally overreacted and shouldn't have cried.

9. **The way I see things/it**, The way I see things, I mad the family photographs a lot more interesting.

10. **As I see things/it**, As I see it, they obviously didn't take me into consideration when drawing up the seating plans. 

11. **It seems to me that**: It seems to me that everyone overreacted when I tried to sit at the top table.

12. **If you ask me**: if you ask me, the church service was wonderful, but it was a shame I had to stand at the back

    

13.  **I'm not going to lie[informal]** (not gonna lie, NGL): I'm not going to lie, I was pretty insulted to not be invited to my ex boyfriend's wedding.

14. **In all honesty** [informal, common], In all honesty, I had every right to be there
