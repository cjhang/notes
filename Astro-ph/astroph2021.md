Galactic outflows are ubiquitous in galaxies. They can be powered by stellar feedback or more energetic AGN feedback, but the exact way to lunch the outflows is still far from being understood. This work proposed a toy model to link the local magnetic with the outflow. To make magnetic strong enough to lead galactic outflows, the crutial question is what is the magnetic seed and how they can be amplified.

The ways to form the magnetic seed field including: mis-alignment of pressure and density gradients(Biermann-battery), Slow down of photons from Thompson scattering, supernovae (ùõº-Œ©-dynamo), and plasma instability (Weibel-Instability). This work more concentrated on the amplication dynamo, which they called $ùõº^2$-Œ©-dynamo, which featured that the small scale magnetic field can be amplified exponentially by small-scale turbulent. In a Milky Way like disk galaxy, the small scale magnetic field can be amplified by the formation of bar, then the strong magnetic field can launch galactic wind.



## Non-thermal filaments from the tidal destruction of clouds in Galactic center

Many non-thermal filaments were found in the Galactic center, with different length and different orientation. However, the longest ones were found to be perpendicular to the Galactic disk and their magnetic is highly ordered (10ùúáG to 1mG) and parallel to its axis. The formation of these kind of filaments has long been a puzzle, though several ways have been  proposed, like shock, stellar wind, outflow.

In this work, the authors have proposed one simple channel to form this magnetized filaments. The figure nicely summarrized their model. When the molecular clouds approach the SMBH (or central stellar cluster), the gravitational force will stretch the clouds in radical direction. At the same time, the closed magnetic field in the clouds will also be stretch along the same direction, and the following magnetic reconnection will make the ordered magnetic field parallel to the axis.

This is a theoretical paper, but the text and the sketch is quite easy to understand. Besides this small scale phenomena in Galactic center, the kinematics induced magnetic field could be also interesting in galactic interactions. If so, we may also expect to find the large scale ordered magnectic field in the tidal distrupted satellites. Beside, it may be important for high-energy physics, since the magnetic reconnection can play some roles here.

Infrare (IR) is essential to probe the on-going star formation activity in galaxies, especially the dust obscured galaxies. But besides star formation, AGN can also heat the dust and thus could potentially dominate the IR luminosity. So in order to better constrain the SFR, dust temperature from total IR luminosity, it is important to quantify the different contribution from star formation and AGN.

In this work, they discussed the contribution from AGN and star formation by their IR luminosity function across cosmic time. It is easier to get the total IR luminosity function, so one important step in this work is to get the pure AGN IR luminosity function independently. What the author did is get the pure AGN IR from hard X-ray sample. Firstly convert the X-ray luminosity to 5100$\AA$ luminosity, then derive total IR luminosity from AGN SED. They found (as shown in the figure) the pure AGN IR luminosity function will converge with the total IR luminosity function of star forming galaxies at high luminosity end. Where the authors interpreted as AGN dominate the IR. With AGN IR luminosity function, they also discussed the correction for SFR and dust temperature derived from total IR luminosity if we seperated the AGN out.

This is a quite straightforward paper and it actually comes out from a couple in UCL. From my understanding, the most critical step for this paper is the derivation of pure AGN luminosity function. Two things may need further discussion is the AGN completeness from hard X-ray sample and the systematic errors when converting X-ray luminosiy to IR luminosity. In short, it is good reference when interpreting the AGN fraction from the SED fitting.



## Fast, Slow, Early, Late: Quenching Massive Galaxies at z ~ 0.8

 It has been years that people are arguing the progenitors of massive ellipticals of our local Universe. One promising candidate is the distant, dusty star forming galaxies (also called submillimeter galaxies, SMGs), who have strong star formation activity and some of them are merging systems. From a rough calculation of SMGs, it they effiently convert all their gas reserviors into stars, they would reach the same stellar mass. But in real galaxies, the formation of massive elliptical galaxies could be much more complex. This work, starts from the quenched galaxies, trying to reproduce their SFH, which could provide insights about their evolution pathes.

To recoverge the SFH of the massive ellipticals, the authors mainly benifit from two things, the first one is the high quality spectra taken from Keck II/DEIMOS and the new non-parametric, Baysian based SFH fitting code *Prospector*. Fig-1 shows the SFHs of their sample. , some of them quench very rapidly while some maintain a stable SFR for a long time. They are quite different from each other, indicating the complex queching paths. On the other hand, they found one intesting pattern in Fig-2, which shows the early formed galaxies have a much shorter star-forming timescale. They also found rejuvenation and "later bloomers" are quite common and they are not exactly following the SFMS.

This is a very nice paper, which provides an independent way to contrain the progenitors of ellipticals. If we put SMGs into Fig-2. they should mosting gathered around the pink and yellow lines. However, **we know SMG can use their molecular gas reservior with in one Gyr**. That may means we definitely needs quite amount of gas inflow to support the formation of their stellar mass.
