  abstract = {Selecting sources with rising flux densities towards longer wavelengths  from Herschel/Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) maps is an efficient way to produce a catalogue rich in high-redshift (z {$>$} 4) dusty star-forming galaxies. The effectiveness of this approach has already been confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up observations, but the previously available catalogues made this way are limited by small survey areas. Here we apply a map-based search method to 274 deg2 of the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) Large Mode Survey and create a catalogue of 477 objects with SPIRE flux densities S500 {$>$} S350 {$>$} S250 and a 5{$\sigma$} cut-off S500 {$>$} 52 mJy. From this catalogue we determine that the total number of these `red' sources is at least an order of magnitude higher than predicted by galaxy evolution models. These results are in agreement with previous findings in smaller HerMES fields; however, due to our significantly larger sample size we are also able to investigate the shape of the red source counts for the first time. We have obtained spectroscopic redshift measurements for two of our sources using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The redshifts z = 5.1 and 3.8 confirm that with our selection method we can indeed find high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies.},

  abstract = {(Abridged) Exploiting the sensitivity and broad band width of NOEMA, we have studied the molecular gas and dust in the galaxy HerBS-89a, at z=2.95. High angular resolution images reveal a partial 1.0" diameter Einstein ring in the dust continuum emission and the molecular emission lines of 12CO(9-8) and H2O(2\_02-1\_11). We report the detection of the three fundamental transitions of the molecular ion OH+, seen in absorption; the molecular ion CH+(1-0) seen in absorption (and tentatively in emission); two transitions of amidogen (NH2), seen in emission; and HCN(11-10) and/or NH(1\_2-0\_1) seen in absorption. The NOEMA data are complemented with VLA data tracing the 12CO(1-0) emission line, which provides a measurement of the total mass of molecular gas and an anchor for a CO excitation analysis. In addition, we present HST imaging that reveals the foreground lensing galaxy in the near-infrared. Together with data from the GTC, we derive a photometric redshift of z(phot)\textasciitilde 0.9 for the foreground lensing galaxy. Modelling the lensing of HerBS-89a, we reconstruct the dust continuum and molecular emission lines (magnified by a factor \textasciitilde 4-5) in the source plane. The 12CO(9-8) and H2O emission lines have comparable spatial and kinematic distributions; the source-plane reconstructions do not clearly distinguish between a one-component and a two-component scenario, but the latter accounts for the observed broad line widths. HerBS-89a is a powerful star forming galaxy with a dust-to-gas ratio delta(GDR)\textasciitilde 80, a SFR = 614 +/- 59 Msun/yr and a depletion timescale tau(depl) = (3.4 +/- 1.0) 1e8 years. The OH+ and CH+ absorption lines, all have their main velocity component red-shifted by \textbackslash Delta(V)\textasciitilde 100 km/s relative to the global CO reservoir. We argue that these absorption lines trace a rare example of gas inflow towards the center of the galaxy.},

We find that the fraction of ALMA-detected galaxies in our z = 1.5-10 samples increases steeply with stellar mass, with the detection fraction rising from 0\% at 109.0 M{$\odot$} to \$\{85\}\_\{-18\}\^\{+9\}\$ \% at {$>$}1010 M{$\odot$}. Moreover, on stacking all 1253 low-mass ({$<$}109.25 M{$\odot$}) galaxies over the ASPECS footprint, we find a mean continuum flux of -0.1 {$\pm$} 0.4 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1, implying a hard upper limit on the obscured star formation rate of {$<$}0.6 M{$\odot$} yr-1 (4{$\sigma$}) in a typical low-mass galaxy. The correlation between the infrared excess (IRX) of UV-selected galaxies (LIR/LUV) and the UV-continuum slope is also seen in our ASPECS data and shows consistency with a Calzetti-like relation at {$>$} \$\{10\}\^\{9.5\}\textbackslash,\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot \}\$ and an SMC-like relation at lower masses. Using stellar mass and {$\beta$} measurements for z {$\sim$} 2 galaxies over the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey, we derive a new empirical relation between {$\beta$} and stellar mass and then use this correlation to show that our IRX-{$\beta$} and IRX-stellar mass relations are consistent with each other. We then use these constraints to express the IRX as a bivariate function of {$\beta$} and stellar mass. Finally, we present updated estimates of star formation rate density determinations at z {$>$} 3, leveraging present improvements in the measured IRX and recent probes of ultraluminous far-IR galaxies at z {$>$} 2.},

  abstract = {Far-infrared and submillimeter wavelength surveys have now established the important role of dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) in the assembly of stellar mass and the evolution of massive galaxies in the Universe. The brightest of these galaxies have infrared luminosities in excess of 1013 L{$\odot$} with implied star-formation rates of thousands of solar masses per year. They represent the most intense starbursts in the Universe, yet many are completely optically obscured. Their easy detection at submm wavelengths is due to dust heated by ultraviolet radiation of newly forming stars. When summed up, all of the dusty, star-forming galaxies in the Universe produce an infrared radiation field that has an equal energy density as the direct starlight emission from all galaxies visible at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. The bulk of this infrared extragalactic background light emanates from galaxies as diverse as gas-rich disks to mergers of intense starbursting galaxies. Major advances in far-infrared instrumentation in recent years, both spacebased and ground-based, has led to the detection of nearly a million DSFGs, yet our understanding of the underlying astrophysics that govern the start and end of the dusty starburst phase is still in nascent stage. This review is aimed at summarizing the current status of DSFG studies, focusing especially on the detailed characterization of the bestunderstood subset (submillimeter galaxies, who were summarized in the last review of this field over a decade ago, Blain et al., 2002), but also the selection and characterization of more recently discovered DSFG populations. We review DSFG population statistics, their physical properties including dust, gas and stellar contents, their environments, and current theoretical models related to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.},

  abstract = {Deep, pencil-beam surveys from ALMA at 1.1-1.3 mm have uncovered an apparent absence of high-redshift dusty galaxies, with existing redshift distributions peaking around z {$\sim$} 1.5-2.5. This has led to a perceived dearth of dusty systems at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 4 and the conclusion, according to some models, that the early universe was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward-evolution galaxy model described by Casey et al. to the ALMA regime (in depth and area) and determine that the measured number counts and redshift distributions from ALMA deep field surveys are fully consistent with constraints of the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) at z {$<$} 2.5 determined by single-dish submillimeter and millimeter surveys conducted on much larger angular scales ({$\sim$}1-10 deg2). We find that measured 1.1-1.3 mm number counts are most constraining for the measurement of the faint-end slope of the IRLF at z {$\lessequivlnt$} 2.5 instead of the prevalence of dusty galaxies at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 4. Recent studies have suggested that UV-selected galaxies at z {$>$} 4 may be particularly dust-poor, but we find that their millimeter-wave emission cannot rule out consistency with the Calzetti dust attenuation law, even by assuming relatively typical, cold-dust (T dust {$\approx$} 30 K) spectral energy distributions. Our models suggest that the design of ALMA deep fields requires substantial revision to constrain the prevalence of z {$>$} 4 early universe obscured starbursts. The most promising avenue for detection and characterization of such early dusty galaxies will come from future ALMA 2 mm blank-field surveys covering a few hundred arcmin2 and the combination of existing and future dual-purpose 3 mm data sets.},

  abstract = {Though half of cosmic starlight is absorbed by dust and reradiated at  long wavelengths (3 {$\mu$}m-3 mm), constraints on the infrared through the millimeter galaxy luminosity function (or the ``IRLF'') are poor in comparison to the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical galaxy luminosity functions, particularly at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2.5. Here, we present a backward evolution model for interpreting number counts, redshift distributions, and cross-band flux density correlations in the infrared and submillimeter sky, from 70 {$\mu$}m-2 mm, using a model for the IRLF out to the epoch of reionization. Mock submillimeter maps are generated by injecting sources according to the prescribed IRLF and flux densities drawn from model spectral energy distributions that mirror the distribution of SEDs observed in 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 5 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We explore two extreme hypothetical case studies: a dust-poor early universe model, where DSFGs contribute negligibly ({$<$}10\%) to the integrated star formation rate density at z {$>$} 4 and an alternate dust-rich early universe model, where DSFGs dominate {$\sim$}90\% of z {$>$} 4 star formation. We find that current submm/mm data sets do not clearly rule out either of these extreme models. We suggest that future surveys at 2 mm will be crucial to measuring the IRLF beyond z {$\sim$} 4. The model framework developed in this paper serves as a unique tool for the interpretation of multiwavelength IR/submm extragalactic data sets, and will enable more refined constraints on the IRLF than can be made from direct measurements of individual galaxies' integrated dust emission.},

  abstract = {We have obtained spectroscopic redshifts using the Keck I telescope for a sample of 73 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), with a median 850  m flux density of 5.7 mJy, for which precise positions are available through their faint radio emission. The galaxies lie at redshifts out to z {$\frac{1}{4}$} 3:6, with a median redshift of 2.2 and an interquartile range z {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1:7\textendash 2.8. Modeling a purely submillimeter flux\textendash limited sample, based on the expected selection function for our radio-identified sample, suggests a median redshift of 2.3, with a redshift distribution remarkably similar to the optically and radio-selected quasars. The observed redshift distributions are similar for the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and starburst subsamples. The median RAB is 24.6 for the sample. However, the dust-corrected ultraviolet (UV) luminosities of the galaxies rarely hint at the huge bolometric luminosities indicated by their radio/submillimeter emission, with the effect that the true luminosity can be underestimated by a median factor of \$120 for SMGs with pure starburst spectra. Radio and submillimeter observations are thus essential to select the most luminous highredshift galaxies. The 850  m, radio, and redshift data are used to estimate the dust temperatures and characterize photometric redshifts. Using 450  m measurements for a subset of our sample, we confirm that a median dust temperature of Td {$\frac{1}{4}$} 36 \AE{} 7 K, derived on the assumption that the local far-infrared (FIR)\textendash radio correlation applies at high redshift, is reasonable. Individual 450  m detections are consistent with the local radio-FIR relation holding at z \$ 2. This median Td is lower than that estimated for similarly luminous IRAS 60  m galaxies locally. We demonstrate that dust temperature variations make it impossible to estimate redshifts for individual SGMs to better than \'Az ' 1 using simple long-wavelength photometric methods. We calculate total infrared and bolometric luminosities (the median infrared luminosity estimated from the radio is 8:5\th\`A74::46 ; 1012 L ), construct a luminosity function, and quantify the strong evolution of the submillimeter population across z {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0:5\textendash 3.5 relative to local IRAS galaxies. We use the bolometric luminosities and UV-spectral classifications to determine a lower limit to the AGN content of the population and measure directly the varying the contribution of highly obscured, luminous galaxies to the luminosity density history of the universe for the first time. We conclude that bright submillimeter galaxies contribute a comparable star formation density to Lyman break galaxies at z {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2\textendash 3, and including galaxies below our submillimeter flux limit, this population may be the dominant site of massive star formation at this epoch. The rapid evolution of SMGs and QSO populations contrasts with that seen in bolometrically lower luminosity galaxy samples selected in the rest-frame UV and suggests a close link between SMGs and the formation and evolution of the galactic halos that host QSOs.},

Using the latest lensing model of A370 and Monte Carlo simulations, we derive the number counts at both wavelengths. The 450 {$\mu$}m number counts probe a factor of four deeper than the counts recently obtained from the Herschel Space Telescope at similar wavelengths, and we estimate that \textasciitilde 47\%-61\% of the 450 {$\mu$}m extragalactic background light resolved into individual sources with 450 {$\mu$}m fluxes greater than 4.5 mJy. The faint 450 {$\mu$}m sources in the 4{$\sigma$} sample have positional accuracies of 3 arcsec, while brighter sources (S/N {$>$}6{$\sigma$}) are good to 1.4 arcsec. Using a deep radio map (1{$\sigma$} \textasciitilde{} 6 {$\mu$}Jy) we find that the percentage of submillimeter sources having secure radio counterparts is 85\% for 450 {$\mu$}m sources with intrinsic fluxes {$>$}6 mJy and 67\% for 850 {$\mu$}m sources with intrinsic fluxes {$>$}4 mJy.

Combined with the source redshifts estimated using millimetric flux ratios, the recovered rate is consistent with the scenario where both 450 {$\mu$}m and 20 cm emission preferentially select lower redshift dusty sources, while 850 {$\mu$}m emission traces a higher fraction of dusty sources at higher redshifts. We identify potential counterparts in various wavelengths from X-ray to mid-infrared and measure the multiwavelength photometry, which we then use to analyze the characteristics of the sources. We find three X-ray counterparts to our robust submillimeter sample (S/N {$>$} 5), giving an active galactic nucleus fraction for our 450 (850) {$\mu$}m sample of 3/8 (3/9) or 38\% (33\%).

SHiZELS-14 displays a compact, dusty central starburst, as well as extended emission in \$\textbackslash rm \{H\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash alpha\$ and the rest-frame optical and FIR. The UV emission is spatially offset from the peak of the dust continuum emission, and appears to trace holes in the dust distribution. We find that the dust attenuation varies across the spatial extent of the galaxy, reaching a peak of at least AH\,{$\alpha$} {$\sim$} 5 in the most dusty regions, although the extinction in the central starburst is likely to be much higher. Global star-formation rates inferred using standard calibrations for the different tracers vary from \$\{\textbackslash sim\}10\textbackslash!-\textbackslash!1000\textbackslash, \textbackslash rm \{M\_\{\textbackslash odot \}\textbackslash, yr\^\{-1\}\}\$, and are particularly discrepant in the galaxy's dusty centre. This galaxy highlights the biased view of the evolution of star-forming galaxies provided by shorter wavelength data.},

  abstract = {We report ground-based follow-up observations of the exceptional source, ID 141, one of the brightest sources detected so far in the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey cosmological survey. ID 141 was observed using the IRAM 30 m telescope and Plateau de Bure interferometer (PdBI), the Submillimeter Array, and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment submillimeter telescope to measure the dust continuum and emission lines of the main isotope of carbon monoxide and carbon ([C I] and [C II]). The detection of strong CO emission lines with the PdBI confirms that ID 141 is at high redshift (z = 4.243 {$\pm$} 0.001). The strength of the continuum and emission lines suggests that ID 141 is gravitationally lensed. The width ({$\Delta$}V FWHM \textasciitilde{} 800 km s-1) and asymmetric profiles of the CO and carbon lines indicate orbital motion in a disk or a merger. The properties derived for ID 141 are compatible with an ultraluminous (L FIR \textasciitilde{} (8.5 {$\pm$} 0.3) \texttimes{} 1013 {$\mu$}-1 L L sun, where {$\mu$}L is the amplification factor), dense (n {$\approx$} 104 cm-3), and warm (T kin {$\approx$} 40 K) starburst galaxy, with an estimated star formation rate of (0.7-1.7) \texttimes{} 104 {$\mu$}-1 L M sun yr-1. The carbon emission lines indicate a dense (n {$\approx$} 104 cm-3) photon-dominated region, illuminated by a far-UV radiation field a few thousand times more intense than that in our Galaxy. In conclusion, the physical properties of the high-z galaxy ID 141 are remarkably similar to those of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies.},

  abstract = {Modern (sub-)millimeter interferometers enable the measurement of the  cool gas and dust emission of high-redshift galaxies (z {$>$} 5). However, at these redshifts the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature is higher, approaching, and even exceeding, the temperature of cold dust and molecular gas observed in the local universe. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the warmer CMB on (sub-)millimeter observations of high-redshift galaxies. The CMB affects the observed (sub-)millimeter dust continuum and the line emission (e.g., carbon monoxide, CO) in two ways: (1) it provides an additional source of (both dust and gas) heating and (2) it is a non-negligible background against which the line and continuum emission are measured. We show that these two competing processes affect the way we interpret the dust and gas properties of high-redshift galaxies using spectral energy distribution models. We quantify these effects and provide correction factors to compute what fraction of the intrinsic dust (and line) emission can be detected against the CMB as a function of frequency, redshift, and temperature. We discuss implications on the derived properties of high-redshift galaxies from (sub-)millimeter data. Specifically, the inferred dust and molecular gas masses can be severely underestimated for cold systems if the impact of the CMB is not properly taken into account.},

We confirm that it is one of the largest known and most overdense high-redshift structures. Such structures are rare even in the largest cosmological simulations. We used the Mayall/MOSAIC1.1 imaging camera to image a 1.\textdegree 2 \texttimes{} 0.\textdegree 6 area ({$\approx$}150 \texttimes{} 75 comoving Mpc) surrounding the protocluster's core and discovered 165 candidate Ly{$\alpha$} emitting galaxies (LAEs) and 788 candidate Lyman Break galaxies (LBGs). There are at least two overdense regions traced by the LAEs, the largest of which shows an areal overdensity in its core (i.e., within a radius of 2.5 comoving Mpc) of 14 {$\pm$} 7 relative to the average LAE spatial density () in the imaged field. Further, is twice that derived by other field LAE surveys. Spectroscopy with Keck/DEIMOS yielded redshifts for 164 galaxies (79 LAEs and 85 LBGs); 65 lie at a redshift of 3.785 {$\pm$} 0.010. The velocity dispersion of galaxies near the core is {$\sigma$} = 350 {$\pm$} 40 km s-1, a value robust to selection effects. The overdensities are likely to collapse into systems with present-day masses of {$>$}1015 M{$\odot$} and {$>$}6 \texttimes{} 1014 M{$\odot$}. The low velocity dispersion may suggest a dynamically young protocluster. We find a weak trend between narrow-band (Ly{$\alpha$}) luminosity and environmental density: the Ly{$\alpha$} luminosity is enhanced on average by 1.35\texttimes{} within the protocluster core. There is no evidence that the Ly{$\alpha$} equivalent width depends on environment. These suggest that star formation and/or active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity is enhanced in the higher-density regions of the structure. PC 217.96+32.3 is a Coma cluster analog, witnessed in the process of formation.},

  abstract = {High-redshift star-forming galaxies have very different morphologies  compared to nearby ones. Indeed, they are often dominated by bright star-forming structures of masses up to 108-9 M{$\odot$} dubbed 'giant clumps'. However, recent observations questioned this result by showing only low-mass structures or no structure at all. We use Adaptative Mesh Refinement hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies with parsec-scale resolution to study the formation of structures inside clumpy high-redshift galaxies. We show that in very gas-rich galaxies star formation occurs in small gas clusters with masses below 107-8 M{$\odot$} that are themselves located inside giant complexes with masses up to 108 and sometimes 109 M{$\odot$}. Those massive structures are similar in mass and size to the giant clumps observed in imaging surveys, in particular with the Hubble Space Telescope. Using mock observations of simulated galaxies, we show that at very high resolution with instruments like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array or through gravitational lensing, only low-mass structures are likely to be detected, and their gathering into giant complexes might be missed. This leads to the non-detection of the giant clumps and therefore introduces a bias in the detection of these structures. We show that the simulated giant clumps can be gravitationally bound even when undetected in mocks representative for ALMA observations and HST observations of lensed galaxies. We then compare the top-down fragmentation of an initially warm disc and the bottom-up fragmentation of an initially cold disc to show that the process of formation of the clumps does not impact their physical properties.},

Our target is a submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z = 2.674 that has a star formation rate of 1200 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$/yr and a molecular gas reservoir of \$1.3\textbackslash times10\^\{11\} M\_\textbackslash odot\$. We characterize its CGM with two background QSOs at impact parameters of 93 kpc and 176 kpc. We detect strong HI and metal-line absorption near the redshift of the SMG towards both QSOs, each consisting of three main subsystems spanning over 1500 km/s. The absorbers show remarkable kinematic and metallicity coherence across a separation of 86 kpc. In particular, the cool gas in the CGM of the SMG exhibits high HI column densities (\$\textbackslash log N\_\{\textbackslash rm HI\}/\{\textbackslash rm cm\}\^\{-2\} = 20.2, 18.6\$), low metallicities ([M/H] \$\textbackslash approx\$ -2.0), and similar radial velocities (\$\textbackslash approx\$ -300 km/s). While the HI column densities match previous results on the CGM around QSOs at z {$>$} 2, the metallicities are lower by more than an order of magnitude, making it an outlier in the line width\$-\$metallicity relation of damped Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ absorbers. The large physical extent, the velocity coherence, the high surface density, and the low metallicity are all consistent with the cool, inflowing, and near-pristine gas streams predicted to penetrate hot massive halos at z {$>$} 1.5. We estimate a total gas accretion rate of \textasciitilde 100 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$/yr from three such streams, which falls short of the star formation rate but is consistent with simulations. At this rate, it takes about a gigayear to acquire the molecular gas reservoir of the central starburst.},

Our sample is a subset of the galaxies selected by Ivison et al. on the basis of their extremely red far-infrared (far-IR) colours and low Herschel flux densities; most are thus expected to be unlensed, extraordinarily luminous starbursts at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 4, modulo the considerable cross-section to gravitational lensing implied by their redshift. We observed 17 of these galaxies with NOEMA and four with ALMA, scanning through the 3-mm atmospheric window. We have obtained secure redshifts for seven galaxies via detection of multiple CO lines, one of them a lensed system at z = 6.027 (two others are also found to be lensed); a single emission line was detected in another four galaxies, one of which has been shown elsewhere to lie at z = 4.002. Where we find no spectroscopic redshifts, the galaxies are generally less luminous by 0.3-0.4 dex, which goes some way to explaining our failure to detect line emission. We show that this sample contains the most luminous known star-forming galaxies. Due to their extreme star-formation activity, these galaxies will consume their molecular gas in {$\lessequivlnt$} 100 Myr, despite their high molecular gas masses, and are therefore plausible progenitors of the massive, 'red-and-dead' elliptical galaxies at z {$\approx$} 3.},

We derive number counts of 1.2 mm continuum sources down to 0.02 mJy partly with the assistance of gravitational lensing, and find that the total integrated 1.2 mm flux of the securely identified sources is \{22.9\}-5.6+6.7 Jy deg-2 which corresponds to \{104\}-25+31\% of the extragalactic background light (EBL) measured by Cosmic Background Explorer observations. These results suggest that the major 1.2 mm EBL contributors are sources with 0.02 mJy, and that very faint 1.2 mm sources with {$\lessequivlnt$}0.02 mJy contribute negligibly to the EBL with the possible flattening and/or truncation of number counts in this very faint flux regime. To understand the physical origin of our faint ALMA sources, we measure the galaxy bias bg by the counts-in-cells technique, and place a stringent upper limit of bg {$<$} 3.5 that is not similar to bg values of massive distant red galaxies and submillimeter galaxies but comparable to those of UV-bright, star-forming BzK galaxies (sBzKs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). Moreover, in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) deep fields, we identify optical-NIR counterparts for 59\% of our faint ALMA sources, the majority of which have luminosities, colors, and the IRX-{$\beta$} relation the same as sBzKs and LBGs. We thus conclude that about a half of our faint ALMA sources are dust-poor, high-z galaxies as known as sBzKs and LBGs in optical studies, and that these faint ALMA sources are not miniature (U)LIRGs simply scaled down with the infrared brightness.},

This is the largest survey of its kind at 850 {$\mu$}m, increasing the sample size of 850 {$\mu$}m selected submillimetre galaxies by an order of magnitude. The wide 850 {$\mu$}m survey component of S2CLS covers the extragalactic fields: UKIDSS-UDS, COSMOS, Akari-NEP, Extended Groth Strip, Lockman Hole North, SSA22 and GOODS-North. The average 1{$\sigma$} depth of S2CLS is 1.2 mJy beam-1, approaching the SCUBA-2 850 {$\mu$}m confusion limit, which we determine to be {$\sigma$}c {$\approx$} 0.8 mJy beam-1. We measure the 850 {$\mu$}m number counts, reducing the Poisson errors on the differential counts to approximately 4 per cent at S850 {$\approx$} 3 mJy. With several independent fields, we investigate field-to-field variance, finding that the number counts on 0.5\textdegree -1\textdegree{} scales are generally within 50 per cent of the S2CLS mean for S850 {$>$} 3 mJy, with scatter consistent with the Poisson and estimated cosmic variance uncertainties, although there is a marginal (2{$\sigma$}) density enhancement in GOODS-North. The observed counts are in reasonable agreement with recent phenomenological and semi-analytic models, although determining the shape of the faint-end slope (S850 {$<$} 3 mJy) remains a key test. The large solid angle of S2CLS allows us to measure the bright-end counts: at S850 {$>$} 10 mJy there are approximately 10 sources per square degree, and we detect the distinctive up-turn in the number counts indicative of the detection of local sources of 850 {$\mu$}m emission, and strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies.

We detect 35 sources at high significance (Fidelity {$\geq$}0.5); 32 have well-characterized near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope counterparts. We estimate the 1.2 mm number counts to flux levels of \$\textbackslash lt 30\textbackslash,\textbackslash mu \textbackslash mathrm\{Jy\}\$ in two different ways: we first use the detected sources to constrain the number counts and find a significant flattening of the counts below S{$\nu$} {$\sim$} 0.1 mJy. In a second approach, we constrain the number counts using a probability of deflection statistics (P(D)) analysis. For this latter approach, we describe new methods to accurately measure the noise in interferometric imaging (employing jackknifing in the cube and in the visibility plane). This independent measurement confirms the flattening of the number counts. Our analysis of the differential number counts shows that we are detecting {$\sim$}93\% ({$\sim$}100\% if we include the lower fidelity detections) of the total continuum dust emission associated with galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The ancillary data allow us to study the dependence of the 1.2 mm number counts on redshift (z = 0-4), galaxy dust mass ( \$\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{dust\}\}=\{10\}\^\{7\}\textbackslash mbox\{--\}\{10\}\^\{9\}\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot \}\$ ), stellar mass ( \$\{M\}\_\{* \}=\{10\}\^\{9\}\textbackslash mbox\{--\}\{10\}\^\{12\}\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot \}\$ ), and star formation rate ( \$\textbackslash mathrm\{SFR\}=1-1000\textbackslash,\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot \}\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash mathrm\{yr\}\}\^\{-1\}\$ ). In an accompanying paper we show that the number counts are crucial to constrain galaxy evolution models and the understanding of star-forming galaxies at high redshift.},

We measure sizes, shapes, and light profiles for the rest-frame far-infrared emission from these luminous star-forming systems and derive a median effective radius (Re) of 0.10 {$\pm$} 0.04 arcsec for our sample with a median flux of S870 = 5.6 {$\pm$} 0.2 mJy. We find that the apparent axial ratio (b/a) distribution of the SMGs peaks at b/a {$\sim$} 0.63 {$\pm$} 0.02 and is best described by triaxial morphologies, while their emission profiles are best fitted by a Se\textasciiacute rsic model with n 1.0 {$\pm$} 0.1, similar to exponential discs. This combination of triaxiality and n {$\sim$} 1 Se\textasciiacute rsic index are characteristic of bars and we suggest that the bulk of the 870 {$\mu$}m dust continuum emission in the central {$\sim$}2 kpc of these galaxies arises from bar-like structures. As such we caution against using the orientation of shape of the bright dust continuum emission at resolution to assess either the orientation of any disc on the sky or tits inclination. By stacking our 870 {$\mu$}m maps we recover faint extended dust continuum emission on {$\sim$}4 kpc scales which contributes 13 {$\pm$} 1 per cent of the total 870 {$\mu$}m emission. The scale of this extended emission is similar to that seen for the molecular gas and rest-frame optical light in these systems, suggesting that it represents an extended dust and gas disc at radii larger than the more active bar component. Including this component in our estimated size of the sources we derive a typical effective radius of 0.15 {$\pm$} 0.05 arcsec or 1.2 {$\pm$} 0.4 kpc. Our results suggest that kpc-scale bars are ubiquitous features of high starformation rate systems at z 1, while these systems also contain fainter and more extended gas and stellar envelopes. We suggest that these features, seen some 10\textendash 12 Gyr ago, represent the formation phase of the earliest galactic-scale components: stellar bulges.},

  abstract = {Submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) have long posed a challenge for theorists, and self-consistently reproducing the properties of the SMG population in a large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulation has not yet been achieved. We use a scaling relation derived from previous simulations plus radiative transfer calculations to predict the submm flux densities of simulated SMGs drawn from cosmological simulations from the Illustris and IllustrisTNG projects based on the simulated galaxies' star formation rates (SFRs) and dust masses and compare the predicted number counts with observations. We find that the predicted SMG number counts based on IllustrisTNG are significantly less than observed (more than 1 dex at \$S\_\{850\} \textbackslash gtrsim 4\$ mJy). The simulation from the original Illustris project yields more SMGs than IllustrisTNG: the predicted counts are consistent with those observed at both \$S\_\{850\} \textbackslash lesssim 5\$ mJy and \$S\_\{850\} \textbackslash gtrsim 9\$ mJy and only a factor of \$\textbackslash sim 2\$ lower than observed at intermediate flux densities. The redshift distribution of SMGs with \$S\_\{850\} {$>$} 3\$ mJy in IllustrisTNG is consistent with the observed distribution, whereas the Illustris redshift distribution peaks at significantly lower redshift (1.5 vs. 2.8). We demonstrate that IllustrisTNG hosts fewer SMGs than Illustris because in the former, high-mass (\$M\_\{\textbackslash star\} \textbackslash sim 10\^\{11\} \textbackslash, \textbackslash text\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) \$z \textbackslash sim 2-3\$ galaxies have lower dust masses and SFRs than in Illustris owing to differences in the sub-grid models for stellar or/and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback between the two simulations (we unfortunately cannot isolate the specific cause(s) post hoc). Our results demonstrate that because our method enables predicting SMG number counts in post-processing with a negligible computational expense, SMGs can provide useful constraints for tuning sub-grid models in future large-volume cosmological simulations.},

Starting with the beginning of early science operations in 2011, the last 9 years of ALMA observations have ushered in a new era for studies of high-redshift star formation. With its long baselines, ALMA has allowed observations of distant dust-obscured star formation with angular resolutions comparable to\textemdash or even far surpassing\textemdash the best current optical telescopes. With its bandwidth and frequency coverage, it has provided an unprecedented look at the associated molecular and atomic gas in these distant galaxies through targeted follow-up and serendipitous detections/blind line scans. Finally, with its leap in sensitivity compared to previous (sub-)millimetre arrays, it has enabled the detection of these powerful dust/gas tracers much further down the luminosity function through both statistical studies of colour/mass-selected galaxy populations and dedicated deep fields. We review the main advances ALMA has helped bring about in our understanding of the dust and gas properties of high-redshift (                                                   z                   {$\greaterequivlnt$}                   1                                               ) star-forming galaxies during these first 9 years of its science operations, and we highlight the interesting questions that may be answered by ALMA in the years to come.},

  abstract = {Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) is an innovative 10 000 pixel bolometer camera operating at submillimetre wavelengths on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). The camera has the capability to carry out wide-field surveys to unprecedented depths, addressing key questions relating to the origins of galaxies, stars and planets. With two imaging arrays working simultaneously in the atmospheric windows at 450 and 850 {$\mu$}m, the vast increase in pixel count means that SCUBA-2 maps the sky 100-150 times faster than the previous SCUBA instrument. In this paper, we present an overview of the instrument, discuss the physical characteristics of the superconducting detector arrays, outline the observing modes and data acquisition, and present the early performance figures on the telescope. We also showcase the capabilities of the instrument via some early examples of the science SCUBA-2 that have already been undertaken. In 2012 February, SCUBA-2 began a series of unique legacy surveys for the JCMT community. These surveys will take 2.5 yr and the results are already providing complementary data to the shorter wavelength, shallower, larger area surveys from Herschel. The SCUBA-2 surveys will also provide a wealth of information for further study with new facilities such as ALMA, and future telescopes such as CCAT and SPICA.},

This galaxy is the brightest source in the fields of six rich, lensing clusters, with a total area of 0.01deg\^2, that we have mapped with a sensitivity of \textasciitilde 2mJybeam\^-1 at 850mum. We identify a compact optical counterpart with an apparent magnitude of B\textasciitilde 23 and a low surface-brightness companion \textasciitilde 3arcsec away. Our spectroscopy shows that both components have the same redshift; z=2.803+/-0.003. The emission line widths, FWHM\textasciitilde =1000-1500kms\^-1, and line ratios, along with the compact morphology and high luminosity (M\_B\textasciitilde =-24.0) of the galaxy, indicate that SMM02399-0136 contains a rare dust-embedded, narrow-line or type-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN). The source is gravitationally lensed by the foreground cluster, amplifying its apparent luminosity by a factor of 2.5, and our detailed lens model allows us to accurately correct for this. Taking the amplification into account, we estimate that SMM02399-0136 is intrinsically a factor of five times more luminous than IRAS F10214+4724. Its far-infrared (FIR) and H{$\alpha$} luminosities and low surface-brightness radio emission are indicative of an interaction-induced starburst, and the star formation rate (SFR) could be several thousand solar masses per year. This assumes that the starburst is the dominant source of energy, but we cannot yet determine reliably the relative contributions of the starburst and the buried AGN. A dust mass of 5-7x10\^8Msolar is indicated by our data for a dust temperature of 40-50K, independent of the dominant energy source. We estimate the possible space density of such luminous submm sources, and find that while a large population of these obscured sources could be detected in future wide-field submm surveys, they are unlikely to dominate the faint counts in this waveband. Galaxies such as SMM02399-0136 and F10214+4724 cannot easily be detected in conventional AGN/QSO surveys, and so estimates of the prevalence of AGN in the early Universe may require significant revision.},

Here, we present the results of new 1.4-GHz imaging of these fields, of the depth and resolution necessary to reliably identify radio counterparts for 18 of 30 submm sources, with possible detections of a further 25 per cent. Armed with this greatly improved positional information, we present and analyse new optical, near-infrared (near-IR) and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging to identify optical/IR host galaxies to half of the submm-selected sources in those fields. As many as 15 per cent of the submm sources detected at 1.4 GHz are resolved by the 1.4-arcsec beam and a further 25 per cent have more than one radio counterpart, suggesting that radio and submm emission arise from extended starbursts and that interactions are common. We note that less than a quarter of the submm-selected sample would have been recovered by targeting optically faint radio sources, underlining the selective nature of such surveys. At least 60 per cent of the radio-confirmed optical/IR host galaxies appear to be morphologically distorted; many are composite systems - red galaxies with relatively blue companions; just over one half are found to be very red (I - K {$>$} 3.3) or extremely red (I - K {$>$} 4); contrary to popular belief, most are sufficiently bright to be tackled with spectrographs on 8-m telescopes. We find one submm source which is associated with the steep-spectrum lobe of a radio galaxy, at least two more with flatter radio spectra typical of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN), one of them variable. The latter is amongst four sources ({$\equiv$}15 per cent of the full sample) with X-ray emission consistent with obscured AGN, though the AGN would need to be Compton thick to power the observed far-IR luminosity. We exploit our well-matched radio and submm data to estimate the median redshift of the S850{$\mu$}m \textasciitilde{} 8 mJy submm galaxy population. If the radio/far-IR correlation holds at high redshift, and our sample is unbiased, we derive a conservative limit of {$<$} z{$>$} {$>$}=2.0, or {$>$}=2.4 using spectral templates more representative of known submm galaxies.},

  abstract = {Until recently, only a handful of dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs)  were known at z {$>$} 4, most of them significantly amplified by gravitational lensing. Here, we have increased the number of such DSFGs substantially, selecting galaxies from the uniquely wide 250, 350, and 500 {$\mu$}m Herschel-ATLAS imaging survey on the basis of their extremely red far-infrared colors and faint 350 and 500 {$\mu$}m flux densities, based on which, they are expected to be largely unlensed, luminous, rare, and very distant. The addition of ground-based continuum photometry at longer wavelengths from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment allows us to identify the dust peak in their spectral energy distributions (SEDs), with which we can better constrain their redshifts. We select the SED templates that are best able to determine photometric redshifts using a sample of 69 high-redshift, lensed DSFGs, then perform checks to assess the impact of the CMB on our technique, and to quantify the systematic uncertainty associated with our photometric redshifts, {$\sigma$} = 0.14 (1 + z), using a sample of 25 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, each consistent with our color selection. For Herschel-selected ultrared galaxies with typical colors of S 500/S 250 {$\sim$} 2.2 and S 500/S 350 {$\sim$} 1.3 and flux densities, S 500 {$\sim$} 50 mJy, we determine a median redshift, \{\textbackslash hat\{z\}\}\{phot\}=3.66, an interquartile redshift range, 3.30-4.27, with a median rest-frame 8-1000 {$\mu$}m luminosity, \{\textbackslash hat\{L\}\}\{IR\}, of 1.3 \texttimes{} 1013 L {$\odot$}.

Multifrequency imaging and spectroscopy revealed a cluster of four dusty galaxies at z = 2.41, covering 80 kpc. Here, we use Atacama Large Millimetre Array to confirm a more distant, fifth protocluster member, and present X-ray and rest-frame optical imaging spectroscopy of the brightest, an unlensed hyperluminous IR galaxy (HyLIRG). The data reveal broad H{$\alpha$} and bright [N II] lines, and bright X-ray emission, characteristics that betray a Type-1 active galactic nucleus (AGN), strengthening evidence that AGN are ubiquitous amongst HyLIRGs. The accreting black hole is supermassive, Mbh {$\approx$} 2 \texttimes{} 109 M{$\odot$}, with little intrinsic absorption, NH {$\approx$} 5 \texttimes{} 1021 cm-2. The X-ray properties suggest the accretion luminosity rivals that of the starburst, yet it is not obvious where this emerges in its panchromatic spectral energy distribution. We outline three scenarios that could give rise to the observed characteristics, and how we might distinguish between them. In the first, we see the AGN through the host galaxy because of the cavity it excavates. In the others, the AGN is not cospatial with the starburst, having been ejected via asymmetric gravitational radiation, or having evolved towards the naked quasar phase in an unseen companion.},

Occasionally, strong gravitational lensing by foreground galaxies or galaxy clusters has probed spatial scales 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller, often revealing late-stage mergers, sometimes with tantalizing hints of sub-structure. One lensed galaxy in particular, the Cosmic Eyelash at z = 2.3, has been cited extensively as an example of where the interstellar medium exhibits obvious, pronounced clumps, on a spatial scale of {$\asymp$}100 pc. Seven orders of magnitude more luminous than giant molecular clouds in the local Universe, these features are presented as circumstantial evidence that the blue clumps observed in many z {$\sim$} 2-3 galaxies are important sites of ongoing star formation, with significant masses of gas and stars. Here, we present data from ALMA which reveal that the dust continuum of the Cosmic Eyelash is in fact smooth and can be reproduced using two S\'ersic profiles with effective radii, 1.2 and 4.4 kpc, with no evidence of significant star-forming clumps down to a spatial scale of {$\asymp$}80 pc and a star formation rate of \&lt;3 M\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}} yr\textsuperscript{-1}.},

We find new members of DRC in three SMG fields; in two fields, the SMGs are shown to lie along the line of sight towards DRC; one SMG is spurious. Although at first sight this rate of association is consistent with earlier predictions, associations with the bright SMGs are rarer than expected, which suggests caution when interpreting continuum overdensities. We consider the implications of all 14 confirmed DRC components passing simultaneously through an active phase of star formation. In the simplest explanation, we see only the tip of the iceberg in terms of star formation and gas available for future star formation, consistent with our remarkable finding that the majority of newly confirmed DRC galaxies are not the brightest continuum emitters in their immediate vicinity. Thus, while ALMA continuum follow-up of SMGs identifies the brightest continuum emitters in each field, it does not necessarily reveal all the gas-rich galaxies. To hunt effectively for protocluster members requires wide and deep spectral-line imaging to uncover any relatively continuum-faint galaxies that are rich in atomic or molecular gas. Searching with short-baseline arrays or single-dish facilities, the true scale of the underlying gas reservoirs may be revealed.},

We have used ALMA to map a sample of 122 870-{$\mu$}m-selected submillimetre sources drawn from the 0.5\textdegree\texttimes 0.5\textdegree{} the Large Apex BOlometer CAmera (LABOCA) Extended Chandra Deep Field South submillimetre survey (LESS). These ALMA maps have an average depth of {$\sigma$}870 {$\mu$}m {$\sim$} 0.4 mJy, some approximately three times deeper than the original LABOCA survey and critically the angular resolution is more than an order of magnitude higher, FWHM of {$\sim$}1.5 arcsec compared to {$\sim$}19 arcsec for the LABOCA discovery map. This combination of sensitivity and resolution allows us to precisely pinpoint the SMGs contributing to the submillimetre sources from the LABOCA map, free from the effects of confusion. We show that our ALMA-derived SMG counts broadly agree with the submillimetre source counts from previous, lower resolution single-dish surveys, demonstrating that the bulk of the submillimetre sources are not caused by blending of unresolved SMGs. The difficulty which well-constrained theoretical models have in reproducing the high surface densities of SMGs, thus remains. However, our observations do show that all of the very brightest sources in the LESS sample, S870 {$\mu$}m {$\greaterequivlnt$} 12 mJy, comprise emission from multiple, fainter SMGs, each with 870-{$\mu$}m fluxes of {$\lessequivlnt$}9 mJy. This implies a natural limit to the star formation rate in SMGs of {$\lessequivlnt$}103 M{$\odot$} yr-1, which in turn suggests that the space densities of z {$>$} 1 galaxies with gas masses in excess of {$\sim$}5 \texttimes{} 1010 M{$\odot$} is {$<$}10-5 Mpc-3. We also discuss the influence of this blending on the identification and characterization of the SMG counterparts to these bright submillimetre sources and suggest that it may be responsible for previous claims that they lie at higher redshifts than fainter SMGs.},

Resolving the CIB to study the population of galaxies in which this activity takes place is a major goal of submillimetre astronomy. Here, we present interferometric 650 {$\mu$}m submillimetre number counts. Using the Band 8 data from the ALMACAL survey, we have analysed 81 ALMA calibrator fields together covering a total area of 5.5 arcmin2. The typical central rms in these fields is {$\sim$}100 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 with the deepest maps reaching {$\sigma$} = 47 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Multiwavelength coverage from ALMACAL allows us to exclude contamination from jets associated with the calibrators. However, residual contamination by jets and lensing remain a possibility. Using a signal-to-noise threshold of 4.5{$\sigma$} , we find 21 dusty, star-forming galaxies with 650 {$\mu$}m flux densities of {$\geq$}0.7mJy. At the detection limit we resolve 100 per cent of the CIB at 650 {$\mu$}m, a significant improvement compared to low-resolution studies at similar wavelength. We have therefore identified all the sources contributing to the EBL at 650 {$\mu$}m and predict that the contribution from objects with flux 0.7 mJy will be small.},

We produce a physical model for the attenuation of galaxies across cosmic time by combining a local Universe empirical relation to compute the dust mass of galaxies from their gas metallicity and mass, attenuation curves derived from radiative transfer calculations of galaxies in the EAGLE hydrodynamic simulation suite, and the properties of SHARK galaxies. We are able to produce a wide range of galaxies, from the z = 8 star-forming galaxies with almost no extinction, z = 2 submillimetre galaxies, down to the normal star-forming and red-sequence galaxies at z = 0. Quantitatively, we find that SHARK reproduces the observed (i) z = 0 FUV-to-FIR, (ii) 0 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 3 rest-frame K-band, and (iii) 0 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 10 rest-frame FUV luminosity functions, (iv) z {$\leq$} 8 UV slopes, (v) the FUV-to-FIR number counts (including the widely disputed 850 {$\mu$}m), (vi) redshift distribution of bright 850 {$\mu$}m galaxies, and (vii) the integrated cosmic SED from z = 0 to 1 to an unprecedented level. This is achieved without the need to invoke changes in the stellar initial mass function, dust-to-metal mass ratio, or metal enrichment time-scales. Our model predicts star formation in galaxy discs to dominate in the FUV-to-optical, while bulges dominate at the NIR at all redshifts. The FIR sees a strong evolution in which discs dominate at z {$\leq$} 1 and starbursts (triggered by both galaxy mergers and disc instabilities, in an even mix) dominate at higher redshifts, even out to z = 10.},

  abstract = {Matching the number counts of high-\$z\$ sub-millimetre-selected galaxies (SMGs) has been a long standing problem for galaxy formation models. In this paper, we use 3D dust radiative transfer to model the sub-mm emission from galaxies in the SIMBA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, and compare predictions to the latest single-dish observational constraints on the abundance of 850\$\textbackslash mathrm\{\textbackslash mu m\}\$-selected sources. We find good agreement with the shape of the integrated 850\$\textbackslash mathrm\{\textbackslash mu m\}\$ luminosity function, and the normalisation is within 0.25 dex at \${$>$} 3 \textbackslash; \textbackslash mathrm\{mJy\}\$, unprecedented for a fully cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, along with good agreement in the redshift distribution of bright SMGs. The agreement is driven primarily by SIMBA's good match to infrared measures of the star formation rate (SFR) function between \$z = 2-4\$ at high SFRs. Also important is the self-consistent on-the-fly dust model in SIMBA, which predicts, on average, higher dust masses (by up to a factor of 2.5) compared to using a fixed dust-to-metals ratio of 0.3. We construct a lightcone to investigate the effect of far-field blending, and find that 52\% of sources are blends of multiple components, which makes a small contribution to the normalisation of the bright-end of the number counts. We provide new fits to the 850\$\textbackslash mathrm\{\textbackslash mu m\}\$ luminosity as a function of SFR and dust mass. Our results demonstrate that exotic solutions to the discrepancy between sub-mm counts in simulations and observations, such as a top-heavy IMF, are unnecessary, and that sub-millimetre-bright phases are a natural consequence of massive galaxy evolution.},

Recent major advances in observing capabilities, in particular the launch of the Herschel Space Observatory in 2009, have dramatically enhanced our ability to use this information in the context of multiwavelength studies of galaxy evolution. Near its peak, three-quarters of the cosmic infrared background is now resolved into individually detected sources. The use of far-infrared diagnostics of dust-obscured star formation and of interstellar medium conditions has expanded from extreme and rare extreme high-redshift galaxies to more typical main-sequence galaxies and hosts of active galactic nuclei out to z 2. These studies shed light on the evolving role of steady equilibrium processes and of brief starbursts at and since the peak of cosmic star formation and black hole accretion.

In this paper, we present a large Spitzer follow-up program of 300 Herschel ultrared DSFGs. We have obtained high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, Northern Extended Millimeter Array, and SMA data for 63 of them, which allow us to securely identify the Spitzer/IRAC counterparts and classify them as gravitationally lensed or unlensed. Within the 63 ultrared sources with high-resolution data, {$\sim$}65\% appear to be unlensed and {$\sim$}27\% are resolved into multiple components. We focus on analyzing the unlensed sample by directly performing multiwavelength spectral energy distribution modeling to derive their physical properties and compare with the more numerous z {$\sim$} 2 DSFG population. The ultrared sample has a median redshift of 3.3, stellar mass of 3.7 \texttimes{} 1011 M {$\odot$}, star formation rate (SFR) of 730 M {$\odot$} yr-1, total dust luminosity of 9.0 \texttimes{} 1012 L {$\odot$}, dust mass of 2.8 \texttimes{} 109 M {$\odot$}, and V-band extinction of 4.0, which are all higher than those of the ALESS DSFGs. Based on the space density, SFR density, and stellar mass density estimates, we conclude that our ultrared sample cannot account for the majority of the star-forming progenitors of the massive, quiescent galaxies found in infrared surveys. Our sample contains the rarer, intrinsically most dusty, luminous, and massive galaxies in the early universe that will help us understand the physical drivers of extreme star formation.},

The catalogs contain 118,908 sources for the NGP field and 193,527 sources for the SGP field detected at more than 4{$\sigma$} significance in any of the 250, 350, or 500 {$\mu$}m bands. The source detection is based on the 250 {$\mu$}m map, and we present photometry in all five bands for each source, including aperture photometry for sources known to be extended. The rms positional accuracy for the faintest sources is about 2.4 arcsec in both R.A. and decl. We present a statistical analysis of the catalogs and discuss the practical issues\textemdash completeness, reliability, flux boosting, accuracy of positions, accuracy of flux measurements\textemdash necessary to use the catalogs for astronomical projects.},

We find a reasonable agreement between the model galaxies within this sample and the properties of the observed submm population, such as their star formation rates (SFRs) at z {$<$} 3, redshift distribution, and many integrated galaxy properties. We find that the median redshift of the S\_\{850 {$\mu$} m\} {$\geq$} 1 mJy model population is z {$\approx$} 2.5, and that they are massive galaxies (M* {$\sim$} 1011 M{$\odot$}) with high dust masses (Mdust {$\sim$} 108 M{$\odot$}), gas fractions (fgas {$\approx$} 50 per cent), and SFRs (\textbackslash dot\{M\}\_* {$\approx$} 100 M{$\odot$} yr-1). In addition, we find that they have major and minor merger fractions similar to the general population, suggesting that mergers are not the sole driver of the high SFRs in the model submm galaxies. Instead, the S\_\{850 {$\mu$} m\} {$\geq$} 1 mJy model galaxies yield high SFRs primarily because they maintain a significant gas reservoir as a result of hosting an undermassive black hole relative to comparably massive galaxies. Not all `highly star-forming' (\textbackslash dot\{M\}\_* {$\geq$} 80 M{$\odot$} yr-1) EAGLE galaxies have submm fluxes S\_\{850 {$\mu$} m\} {$\geq$} 1 mJy. We investigate the nature of these highly star-forming `Submm-Faint' galaxies (i.e. \textbackslash dot\{M\}\_* {$\geq$} 80 M{$\odot$} yr-1 but S\_\{850 {$\mu$} m\} {$<$} 1 mJy) and find that they are similar to the model submm galaxies, being gas rich and hosting undermassive black holes. However, they are also typically at higher redshifts (z {$>$} 4) and are lower mass (M* {$\sim$} 1010 M{$\odot$}). These typically higher redshift galaxies show stronger evidence for having been triggered by major mergers, and critically, they are likely missed by most current submm surveys due to their higher dust temperatures and lower dust masses.},

  abstract = {Massive galaxy clusters have been found that date to times as early as three billion years after the Big Bang, containing stars that formed at even earlier epochs1-3. The high-redshift progenitors of these galaxy clusters\textemdash termed `protoclusters'\textemdash can be identified in cosmological simulations that have the highest overdensities (greater-than-average densities) of dark matter4-6. Protoclusters are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies that can be observed as luminous starbursts7. However, recent detections of possible protoclusters hosting such starbursts8-11 do not support the kind of rapid cluster-core formation expected from simulations12: the structures observed contain only a handful of starbursting galaxies spread throughout a broad region, with poor evidence for eventual collapse into a protocluster. Here we report observations of carbon monoxide and ionized carbon emission from the source SPT2349-56. We find that this source consists of at least 14 gas-rich galaxies, all lying at redshifts of 4.31. We demonstrate that each of these galaxies is forming stars between 50 and 1,000 times more quickly than our own Milky Way, and that all are located within a projected region that is only around 130 kiloparsecs in diameter. This galaxy surface density is more than ten times the average blank-field value (integrated over all redshifts), and more than 1,000 times the average field volume density. The velocity dispersion (approximately 410 kilometres per second) of these galaxies and the enormous gas and star-formation densities suggest that this system represents the core of a cluster of galaxies that was already at an advanced stage of formation when the Universe was only 1.4 billion years old. A comparison with other known protoclusters at high redshifts shows that SPT2349-56 could be building one of the most massive structures in the Universe today.},

  abstract = {Context. Characterizing the number counts of faint (i.e., sub-mJy and  especially sub-100 {$\mu$}Jy), dusty star-forming galaxies is currently a challenge even for deep, high-resolution observations in the FIR-to-mm regime. They are predicted to account for approximately half of the total extragalactic background light at those wavelengths. Searching for dusty star-forming galaxies behind massive galaxy clusters benefits from strong lensing, enhancing their measured emission while increasing spatial resolution. Derived number counts depend, however, on mass reconstruction models that properly constrain these clusters.  Aims: We aim to estimate the 1.1 mm number counts along the line of sight of three galaxy clusters, Abell 2744, MACS J0416.1-2403, and MACS J1149.5+2223, which are part of the ALMA Frontier Fields Survey. We have performed detailed simulations to correct these counts for lensing effects, probing down to the sub-mJy flux density level. Methods: We created a source catalog based on ALMA 1.1 mm continuum detections. We used several publicly available lensing models for the galaxy clusters to derive the intrinsic flux densities of these sources. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of the number counts for a detailed treatment of the uncertainties in the magnifications and adopted source redshifts. Results: We estimate lensing-corrected number counts at 1.1 mm using source detections down to S/N = 4.5. In each cluster field, we find an overall agreement among the number counts derived for the different lens models, despite their systematic variations regarding source magnifications and effective areas. Combining all cluster fields, our number counts span {$\sim$}2.5 dex in demagnified flux density, from several mJy down to tens of {$\mu$}Jy. Both our differential and cumulative number counts are consistent with recent estimates from deep ALMA observations at a 3{$\sigma$} level. Below {$\approx$}0.1 mJy, however, our cumulative counts are lower by {$\approx$}1 dex, suggesting a flattening in the number counts. Conclusions: We derive 1.1 mm number counts around three well-studied galaxy clusters following a statistical approach. In our deepest ALMA mosaic, we estimate number counts for intrinsic flux densities {$\approx$}4 times fainter than the rms level. This highlights the potential of probing the sub-10 {$\mu$}Jy population in larger samples of galaxy cluster fields with deeper ALMA observations.},

We identify faint SMGs with flux densities of 0.1-1.0 mJy in the deep Band-6 and Band-7 maps of 10 independent fields that reduce cosmic variance effects. The differential number counts at 1.2 mm are found to increase with decreasing flux density down to 0.1 mJy. Our number counts indicate that the faint (0.1-1.0 mJy, or SFRIR \textasciitilde{} 30-300 M {$\odot$} yr-1) SMGs contribute nearly a half of the extragalactic background light (EBL), while the remaining half of the EBL is mostly contributed by very faint sources with flux densities of {$<$}0.1 mJy (SFRIR {$<\sptilde$} 30 M {$\odot$} yr-1). We conduct counts-in-cells analysis with multifield ALMA data for the faint SMGs, and obtain a coarse estimate of galaxy bias, b g {$<$} 4. The galaxy bias suggests that the dark halo masses of the faint SMGs are {$<\sptilde$} 7 \texttimes{} 1012 M {$\odot$}, which is smaller than those of bright ({$>$}1 mJy) SMGs, but consistent with abundant high-z star-forming populations, such as sBzKs, LBGs, and LAEs. Finally, we report the serendipitous detection of SLE-1, which has no continuum counterparts in our 1.2 mm-band or multi-wavelength images, including ultra deep HST/WFC3 and Spitzer data. The SLE has a significant line at 249.9 GHz with a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.1. If the SLE is not a spurious source made by the unknown systematic noise of ALMA, the strong upper limits of our multi-wavelength data suggest that the SLE would be a faint galaxy at z {$>\sptilde$} 6.},

These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. By gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper, we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analyzed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of {$\sim$}25 {$\mu$}Jy beam-1 at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on 5{$\sigma$} detections, we have found 8 and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities S1.2 mm0.2 mJy. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest Herschel surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 {$\mu$}m and 1.2 mm from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least 2\texttimes. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs with redshifts determined via the detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows for morphological studies of very faint DSFGs\textemdash representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies\textemdash in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution.},

The velocity information provided by the resolved [C II] emission reveals that the dynamics of the two interacting components of SGP38326 are each compatible with disk-like, ordered rotation, but also reveals an ISM which is turbulent and unstable.

Median stellar mass (\$\textbackslash simeq6.5\textbackslash times10\^\{10\}\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$) and SFR (\$\textbackslash simeq241\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ yr\$\^\{-1\}\$) are consistent with galaxy main-sequence at \$z\textbackslash sim2\$.

This evidence, along with their compact multi-wavelength sizes (median r\$\_\{\textbackslash rm ALMA\}\textbackslash sim\$ r\$\_\{\textbackslash rm VLA\}=1.8\$ kpc, r\$\_\{\textbackslash rm HST\}=2.3\$ kpc) measured from high-resolution imaging (\$\textbackslash theta\_\{\textbackslash rm res\}\textbackslash lesssim\$ 1 arcsec), indicates these objects as the high-z star-forming counterparts of massive quiescent galaxies, as predicted e.g., by the in-situ scenario. Four objects show some signatures of a forthcoming/ongoing AGN feedback, that is thought to trigger the morphological transition from star-forming disks to ETGs.},

  abstract = {We present a new semiempirical model for the dust continuum number  counts of galaxies at 1.1 mm and 850 {$\mu$}m. Our approach couples an observationally motivated model for the stellar mass and star formation rate distribution of galaxies with empirical scaling relations to predict the dust continuum flux density of these galaxies. Without a need to tweak the IMF, the model reproduces the currently available observations of the 1.1 mm and 850 {$\mu$}m number counts, including the observed flattening in the 1.1 mm number counts below 0.3 mJy and the number counts in discrete bins of different galaxy properties. Predictions of our work include the following: (1) the galaxies that dominate the number counts at flux densities below 1 mJy (3 mJy) at 1.1 mm (850 {$\mu$}m) have redshifts between z = 1 and z = 2, stellar masses of {$\sim$}5 \texttimes{} 1010 M{$\odot$}, and dust masses of {$\sim$}108 M{$\odot$}; (2) the flattening in the observed 1.1 mm number counts corresponds to the knee of the 1.1 mm luminosity function. A similar flattening is predicted for the number counts at 850 {$\mu$}m; (3) the model reproduces the redshift distribution of current 1.1 mm detections; and (4) to efficiently detect large numbers of galaxies through their dust continuum, future surveys should scan large areas once reaching a 1.1 mm flux density of 0.1 mJy rather than integrating to fainter fluxes. Our modeling framework also suggests that the amount of information on galaxy physics that can be extracted from the 1.1 mm and 850 {$\mu$}m number counts is almost exhausted.},

The cold dust is distributed within the smooth disklike central regions of star formation 1-3 kpc in diameter, despite their complex and disturbed rest-frame UV and optical morphologies. No dust substructures or clumps are seen down to {$\simeq$}1-3 \{M\}{$\odot$}  yr-1 (1{$\sigma$}) per 200 pc beam. No dust emission is observed at the locations of UV-emitting clumps, which lie {$\simeq$}2-10 kpc from the bulk of star formation. Clumpy substructures can contribute no more than 1\%-7\% of the total star formation in these galaxies (3{$\sigma$} upper limits). The lack of star-forming substructures in our HUDF galaxies is to be contrasted with the multiple substructures characteristic of submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) at the same cosmic epoch, particularly the far-IR-bright SMGs with similarly high-fidelity ALMA observations of Hodge et al. Individual star-forming substructures in these SMGs contain {$\sim$}10\%-30\% of their total star formation. A substructure in these SMGs is often comparably bright in the far-infrared to (or in some cases brighter than) our typical SFGs, suggesting that these SMGs originate from a class of disruptive events involving multiple objects at the scale of our HUDF galaxies. The scale of the disruptive event found in our main-sequence SFGs, characterized by the lack of star-forming substructures at our resolution and sensitivity, could be less violent, e.g., gas-rich disk instability or minor mergers.},

The trigger for the intense infrared emission appears to be the strong interaction/merger of molecular gas-rich spirals, and the bulk of the infrared luminosity for all but the most luminous objects is due to dust heating from an intense starburst within giant molecular clouds. At the highest luminosities (Lir {$>$} 1012 ), nearly all objects appear to be advanced mergers powered by a mixture of circumnuclear starburst and active galactic nucleus energy sources, both of which are fueled by an enormous concentration of molecular gas that has been funneled into the merger nucleus.

They may also represent a primary stage in the formation of elliptical galaxy cores, the formation of globular clusters, and the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium.},

Both samples are \$\textbackslash rm H\textbackslash alpha\$ emitting sources, chosen from the HiZELS narrow-band survey, with metallicities derived from \$\textbackslash rm N2\textbackslash{} (\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash rm [NII] \textbackslash lambda 6584\}\{\textbackslash rm H \textbackslash alpha\})\$ line ratio. For the mass-matched samples of protocluster and field galaxies, we find that protocluster galaxies with \$10\^\{9.9\} \textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot \textbackslash leq M\_* \textbackslash leq 10\^\{10.9\} \textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$ are metal deficient by \$0.10 \textbackslash pm 0.04\$ dex (\$2.5\textbackslash sigma\$ significance) compared to their coeval field galaxies. This metal deficiency is absent for low mass galaxies, \$\textbackslash rm M\_* {$<$} 10\^\{9.9\} \textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$. Moreover, relying on both SED-derived and \$\textbackslash rm \{H\textbackslash alpha\}\$ (corrected for dust extinction based on \$\textbackslash rm \{M\_*\}\$) SFRs, we find no strong environmental dependence of SFR-\$\textbackslash rm \{M\_*\}\$ relation, however, we are not able to rule out the existence of small dependence due to inherent uncertainties in both SFR estimators. The existence of \$2.5\textbackslash sigma\$ significant metal deficiency for massive protocluster galaxies favors a model in which funneling of the primordial cold gas through filaments dilutes the metal content of protoclusters at high redshifts (\$z \textbackslash gtrsim 2\$). At these redshifts, gas reservoirs in filaments are dense enough to cool down rapidly and fall into the potential well of the protocluster to lower the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies. Moreover, part of this metal deficiency could be originated from galaxy interactions which are more prevalent in dense environments.},

Using the photometric redshifts of the SMGs we show that this corresponds to a median physical half-light diameter of 2.4 {$\pm$} 0.2 kpc. A stacking analysis of the SMGs detected at S/N {$<$}10 shows they have sizes consistent with the 870 {$\mu$}m bright SMGs in the sample. We compare our results to the sizes of SMGs derived from other multi-wavelength studies, and show that the rest-frame \textasciitilde 250 {$\mu$}m sizes of SMGs are consistent with studies of resolved 12CO (J = 3-2 to 7-6) emission lines, but that sizes derived from 1.4 GHz imaging appear to be approximately two times larger on average, which we attribute to cosmic ray diffusion. The rest-frame optical sizes of SMGs are around four times larger than the sub-millimeter sizes, indicating that the star formation in these galaxies is compact relative to the pre-existing stellar distribution. The size of the starburst region in SMGs is consistent with the majority of the star formation occurring in a central region, a few kiloparsecs in extent, with a median star formation rate surface density of 90 {$\pm$} 30 M {$\odot$} yr-1 kpc-2, which may suggest that we are witnessing an intense period of bulge growth in these galaxies.},

We have mapped fields in two massive, concentrated clusters, A370 at z ϭ 0.37 and Cl 2244Ϫ02 at z ϭ 0.33, at wavelengths of 450 and 850 mm. The resulting continuum maps cover a total area of about 10 arcmin2 to 1 j noise levels less than 14 and 2 mJy beamϪ1 at the two wavelengths, 2\textendash 3 orders of magnitude deeper than was previously possible. We have concentrated on lensing clusters to exploit the amplification of all background sources by the cluster, improving the sensitivity by a factor of 1.3\textendash 2 as compared with a blank-field survey. A cumulative source surface density of (2.4 ע 1.0) \# 103 degϪ2 is found to a 50\% completeness limit of {$\sim$}4 mJy at 850 mm. The submillimeter spectral properties of these sources indicate that the majority lie at high redshift, z 1 1. Without correcting for lens amplification, our observations limit the blank-field counts at this depth. The surface density is 3 orders of magnitude greater than the expectation of a nonevolving model using the local IRAS 60 mm luminosity function. The observed source counts thus require a substantial increase in the number density of strongly star-forming galaxies in the high-redshift universe and suggest that optical surveys may have substantially underestimated the star formation density in the distant universe. Deeper submillimeter surveys with SCUBA should detect large numbers of star-forming galaxies at high redshift and so provide strong constraints on the formation of normal galaxies.},

  abstract = {Massive galaxy-scale outflows of gas are one of the most commonly invoked mechanisms to regulate the growth and evolution of galaxies throughout the universe. While the gas in outflows spans a large range of temperatures and densities, the cold molecular phase is of particular interest because molecular outflows may be capable of suppressing star formation in galaxies by removing the star-forming gas. We have conducted the first survey of molecular outflows at z{$>$}4, targeting 11 strongly lensed dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) with highresolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of OH 119 {$\mu$}m absorption as an outflow tracer. In this first paper, we give an overview of the survey, focusing on the detection rate and structure of molecular outflows. We find unambiguous evidence for outflows in 8/11 galaxies (73\%), more than tripling the number known at z{$>$}4. This implies that molecular winds in z{$>$}4 DSFGs must have both a near-unity occurrence rate and large opening angles to be detectable in absorption. Lensing reconstructions reveal that 500 pc scale clumpy structures in the outflows are common. The individual clumps are not directly resolved, but from optical depth arguments we expect that future observations will require 50\textendash 200 pc spatial resolution to resolve them. We do not detect high-velocity [C II] wings in any of the sources with clear OH outflows, indicating that [C II] is not a reliable tracer of molecular outflows. Our results represent a first step toward characterizing molecular outflows at z{$>$}4 at the population level, demonstrating that large-scale outflows are ubiquitous among early massive, dusty galaxies.},

The S2CLS parent sample covers a 0.96 degree2 field at {$\sigma$} 850 = 0.90 {$\pm$} 0.05 mJy beam-1. Our deep, high-resolution ALMA observations with {$\sigma$} 870 {$\sim$} 0.25 mJy and a 0.{${''}$}15-0.{${''}$}30 FWHM synthesized beam, provide precise locations for 695 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) responsible for the submillimeter emission corresponding to 606 sources in the low-resolution, single-dish map. We measure the number counts of SMGs brighter than S 870 {$\geq$} 4 mJy, free from the effects of blending and show that the normalization of the counts falls by 28\% {$\pm$} 2\% in comparison with the SCUBA-2 published counts, but that the shape remains unchanged. We determine that \{44\}-14+16\% of the brighter single-dish sources with S 850 {$\geq$} 9 mJy consist of a blend of two or more ALMA-detectable SMGs brighter than S 870 {$\sim$} 1 mJy (corresponding to a galaxy with a total-infrared luminosity of L IR {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1012 L {$\odot$}), in comparison with 28\% {$\pm$} 2\% for the single-dish sources at S 850 {$\geq$} 5 mJy. Using the 46 single-dish submillimeter sources that contain two or more ALMA-detected SMGs with photometric redshifts, we show that there is a significant statistical excess of pairs of SMGs with similar redshifts ({$<$}1\% probability of occurring by chance), suggesting that at least 30\% of these blends arise from physically associated pairs of SMGs.},

In our sensitive ALMA follow-up observations, we detect 708 sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) at {$>$}4.3{$\sigma$} significance across the {$\sim$}1\textdegree -diameter field. We combine our precise ALMA positions with the extensive multiwavelength coverage in the UDS field which yields spectral energy distributions for our SMGs and a median redshift of zphot = 2.61 {$\pm$} 0.09. This large sample reveals a statistically significant trend of increasing sub-millimetre flux with redshift suggestive of galaxy downsizing. 101 ALMA maps do not show a {$>$} 4.3{$\sigma$} SMG, but we demonstrate from stacking Herschel SPIRE observations at these positions, that the vast majority of these blank maps correspond to real single-dish sub-millimetre sources. We further show that these blank maps contain an excess of galaxies at zphot = 1.5-4 compared to random fields, similar to the redshift range of the ALMA-detected SMGs. In addition, we combine X-ray and mid-infrared active galaxy nuclei activity (AGN) indicators to yield a likely range for the AGN fraction of 8-28 per cent in our sample. Finally, we compare the redshifts of this population of high-redshift, strongly star-forming galaxies with the inferred formation redshifts of massive, passive galaxies being found out to z {$\sim$} 2, finding reasonable agreement - in support of an evolutionary connection between these two classes of massive galaxy.},

The results reveal luminosity densities comparable to those of the dense cores of giant molecular clouds in the local Universe, suggesting that the underlying physics of star formation is similar to that of nearby galaxies, though the regions in the distant galaxies are about 100 times larger and 107 times more luminous overall.},

  abstract = {We investigate the balance of power between stars and AGN across cosmic history, based on the comparison between the infrared (IR) galaxy luminosity function (LF) and the IR AGN LF. The former corresponds to emission from dust heated by stars and AGN, whereas the latter includes emission from AGN-heated dust only. We find that at all redshifts (at least up to z\textasciitilde 2.5), the high luminosity tails of the two LFs converge, indicating that the most infrared-luminous galaxies are AGN-powered. Our results shed light to the decades-old conundrum regarding the flatter high-luminosity slope seen in the IR galaxy LF compared to that in the UV and optical. We attribute this difference to the increasing fraction of AGN-dominated galaxies with increasing total infrared luminosity (L\_IR). We partition the L\_IR-z parameter space into a star-formation and an AGN-dominated region, finding that the most luminous galaxies at all epochs lie in the AGN-dominated region. This sets a potential `limit' to attainable star formation rates, casting doubt on the abundance of `extreme starbursts': if AGN did not exist, L\_IR{$>$}10\^13 Lsun galaxies would be significantly rarer than they currently are in our observable Universe. We also find that AGN affect the average dust temperatures (T\_dust) of galaxies and hence the shape of the well-known L\_IR-T\_dust relation. We propose that the reason why local ULIRGs are hotter than their high redshift counterparts is because of a higher fraction of AGN-dominated galaxies amongst the former group.},

  abstract = {We combine the recent determination of the evolution of the cosmic  density of molecular gas (H2) using deep, volumetric surveys, with previous estimates of the cosmic density of stellar mass, star formation rate and atomic gas (H I), to constrain the evolution of baryons associated with galaxies averaged over cosmic time and space. The cosmic H I and H2 densities are roughly equal at z {$\sim$} 1.5. The H2 density then decreases by a factor \$\{6\}\_\{-2\}\^\{+3\}\$ to today's value, whereas the H I density stays approximately constant. The stellar mass density is increasing continuously with time and surpasses that of the total gas density (H I and H2) at redshift z {$\sim$} 1.5. The growth in stellar mass cannot be accounted for by the decrease in cosmic H2 density, necessitating significant accretion of additional gas onto galaxies. With the new H2 constraints, we postulate and put observational constraints on a two-step gas accretion process: (i) a net infall of ionized gas from the intergalactic/circumgalactic medium to refuel the extended H I reservoirs, and (ii) a net inflow of H I and subsequent conversion to H2 in the galaxy centers. Both the infall and inflow rate densities have decreased by almost an order of magnitude since z {$\sim$} 2. Assuming that the current trends continue, the cosmic molecular gas density will further decrease by about a factor of two over the next 5 Gyr, the stellar mass will increase by approximately 10\%, and cosmic star formation activity will decline steadily toward zero, as the gas infall and accretion shut down.},

The sources were selected to have S 1.4 mm {$>$} 20 mJy and a dust-like spectrum and, to remove low-z sources, not have bright radio (S 843 MHz {$<$} 6 mJy) or far-infrared counterparts (S 100 {$\mu$}m {$<$} 1 Jy, S 60 {$\mu$}m {$<$} 200 mJy). We robustly detect 44 line features in our survey, which we identify as redshifted emission lines of 12CO, 13CO, C I, H2O, and H2O+. We find one or more spectral features in 23 sources yielding a \textasciitilde 90\% detection rate for this survey; in 12 of these sources we detect multiple lines, while in 11 sources we detect only a single line. For the sources with only one detected line, we break the redshift degeneracy with additional spectroscopic observations if available, or infer the most likely line identification based on photometric data. This yields secure redshifts for \textasciitilde 70\% of the sample. The three sources with no lines detected are tentatively placed in the redshift desert between 1.7 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.0. The resulting mean redshift of our sample is \textbackslash bar\{z\} = 3.5. This finding is in contrast to the redshift distribution of radio-identified DSFGs, which have a significantly lower mean redshift of \textbackslash bar\{z\} = 2.3 and for which only 10\%-15\% of the population is expected to be at z {$>$} 3. We discuss the effect of gravitational lensing on the redshift distribution and compare our measured redshift distribution to that of models in the literature.},

We present a programme of FIR spectroscopic observations with the SPIRE FTS, as well as photometric observations with PACS, both on board Herschel, towards a sample of 45 gravitationally lensed, dusty starbursts across z {$\sim$} 1-3.6. In total, we detected 27 individual lines down to 3 {$\sigma$}, including nine [C II] 158 {$\mu$}m lines with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts, five possible [C II] lines consistent with their FIR photometric redshifts, and in some individual sources a few [O III] 88 {$\mu$}m, [O III] 52 {$\mu$}m, [O I] 145 {$\mu$}m, [O I] 63 {$\mu$}m, [N II] 122 {$\mu$}m and OH 119 {$\mu$}m (in absorption) lines. To derive the typical physical properties of the gas in the sample, we stack all spectra weighted by their intrinsic luminosity and by their 500{$\mu$}m flux densities, with the spectra scaled to a common redshift. In the stacked spectra, we detect emission lines of [C II] 158 {$\mu$}m, [N II] 122 {$\mu$}m, [O III] 88 {$\mu$}m, [O III] 52 {$\mu$}m, [O I] 63 {$\mu$}m and the absorption doublet of OH at 119 {$\mu$}m, at high fidelity. We find that the average electron densities traced by the [N II] and [O III] lines are higher than the average values in local star-forming galaxies and ULIRGs, using the same tracers. From the [N II]/[C II] and [O I]/[C II] ratios, we find that the [C II] emission is likely dominated by the photodominated regions (PDR), instead of by ionized gas or large-scale shocks.},

  abstract = {All measurements of cosmic star formation must assume an initial  distribution of stellar masses\textemdash the stellar initial mass function\textemdash in order to extrapolate from the star-formation rate measured for typically rare, massive stars (of more than eight solar masses) to the total star-formation rate across the full stellar mass spectrum1. The shape of the stellar initial mass function in various galaxy populations underpins our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time2. Classical determinations of the stellar initial mass function in local galaxies are traditionally made at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths, which cannot be probed in dust-obscured galaxies2,3, especially distant starbursts, whose apparent star-formation rates are hundreds to thousands of times higher than in the Milky Way, selected at submillimetre (rest-frame far-infrared) wavelengths4,5. The 13C/18O isotope abundance ratio in the cold molecular gas\textemdash which can be probed via the rotational transitions of the 13CO and C18O isotopologues\textemdash is a very sensitive index of the stellar initial mass function, with its determination immune to the pernicious effects of dust. Here we report observations of 13CO and C18O emission for a sample of four dust-enshrouded starbursts at redshifts of approximately two to three, and find unambiguous evidence for a top-heavy stellar initial mass function in all of them. A low 13CO/C18O ratio for all our targets\textemdash alongside a well tested, detailed chemical evolution model benchmarked on the Milky Way6\textemdash implies that there are considerably more massive stars in starburst events than in ordinary star-forming spiral galaxies. This can bring these extraordinary starbursts closer to the `main sequence' of star-forming galaxies7, although such main-sequence galaxies may not be immune to changes in initial stellar mass function, depending on their star-formation densities.},
