## [C II] 158$\mu$m

[C II] 158$\mu$m, the brightest line in the Far-IR, have been widely disscussed for the most high-redshift galaxies.

Bradac+17, LAE at 6,766, show [C II] deficits, possible due to low metallicity

Carniani+17, [C II] and [O III]58$\mu$m were both detected in a normal galaxy, significant offset from the UV and show clumpy structures.



[C II] extended halo: 

observation: Fujimoto+19 and Ginolfi+20

From simulation:

- Inclination effects., Kohandel+19



[C II] deficit

- Metal poor, not so many C
- Halo or outflow? (Andrea Ferrara team)
