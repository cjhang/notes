# Science Projects

## ALMACAL

ALMACAL is the ALMA ancillary project, which collects all the observations of the ALMA calibrators. 

1. ~~ALMACAL time domain data, can be used to trace the gas filaments fast motion in the early Universe?~~

   > - the residual of the central point source may dominate the noise, which will create some fake variational signal.

2. Find the proto-group in deep small field observation? Galaxy group is smaller than galaxy cluster, so ALMACAL can be used to search for proto-groups in the early Universe.

   > It is also very difficult to confirm their redshift. Beside, finding way to remove the residuals of in the final image can be critical for the faint objects in the calibrators' field.

3. Line searching, 

   > OH$^+$ CH$^+$ are low density tracers, they are usually observed in obsorption, which can be used to search gas inflow and outflow of the blazers.  [Barte+2020]

## Early Universe

1. There is initial mass function for stars, how about the initial mass function for galaxies? Will that matters for the proto-cluster formation or can it be the characteristics to distinguish different evolution stage of clusters? Any possible for the initial mass function of black whole seed at the reionization era?

2. **Determine the kinematics of [C II] and the other gas phase tracer**

   > The [C II] has been widely used to study the kinematics or even the dynamics of high-z galaxies. However, little researchs have been focused on their validity. The FIEA on SOFIA can be the best instrument to study the [C II] kinematics of local spiral or starburst galaxies.
   >
   > The target can also be some metal-poor or low-ionization dwarf
   >
   > **Using simalma to test the spatial resolution effect on the interpretation of the kinematics from [C II]**

3. Study the role of star formation efficiency in spiral. Any enhancement?

   > This thought comes out when I read the study about the Milky Way's spiral arms. They did not find significant strengthen of SFE in the spiral arms. They argued the large star formation surface density is mainly because the higher efficiency of converting atomic hydrogen to molecular gas.
   >
   > Another crazy idea: it is possible the molecular gas are also not formed in the spiral arms, but only due to some dynamic friction+gravitational contraction?

4. Find MW analoges in the early Universe

   > SPT0418-47 galaxy is thought to be alike MK from their kinematic signature. How about the SED and the environment?

5. **Are high-z starburst galaxies are mostly regular rotation dominate?**

   > From current high resolution [C II] observations, it seems that most galaxies with strong [C II] are rotation dominated. Since most of these galaxies only barely resolved, so it definitely need the kinematics from other gas tracer. **Maybe one proposal for next ALMA cycle**

6. ~~Measuring the magnetic filed in the submillimeter bright galaxies and the Lyman-a galaxies in very high-z galaxies, additional evidence of the high turbulence?~~

   > The kinetic SZ effect and the synchrotron are both hard to measure at early Univere, but it definitely important for future surveys

7. Try to observe the magnetic at high-z galaxies.

   > The first ideal target could be the strong lensed source, they were bright and could reach a relative high angular resolution.
   >
   > - Red Radio Ring (Geach+2015)
   >- [ ] read the review paper of magnetic field measures, and test the possibility to measure the magnetic field in high-z Universe

8. The rotation curve of proto-cluster: resolved central galaxies + general circular motion of the satellite galaxies

   > The best candidate for such a testing is the two hypoluminous proto-clusters find in 2018
   
9. The connection bettween lyman-break galactic proto-cluster and the SMG photo-cluster

10. X-ray survey of SMGs

    > 1. One possible project is to make a small survey of Chandra observation for ~10 brightest, but not lensed SMG, to see their X-ray occupation. 
    >
    > 2. Based on the VLA observation of several SMGs, we can predict its X-ray luminosity based on their 

## AGN

1. Find timescale than AGN activity before  star formation, find evidence of AGN enhance star formation. Jet produce ring star formation, alpha/Fe abundance.
2. Gas replenish in the Elliptical galaxies, the frequency, the importance, the origin. High star formation efficiency in early type galaxies 

## Cosmological evolution of baryons

1. The available molelular gas reservior is somehow consistent with cosmic star formation trend. However, the atomic gas follows the general slihtly flat trend from early Universe to local Universe. One possible issue may be the dection of atomic gas in the early Universe. 

## Local galaxies

1. High resolution observation of local galaxies with low inclination angle, seperating out the weak outflow

   > It relies on the model subtraction to reomove the strong regular rotation, so that it where the uncertainty comes from.

2. DESI has much better coverage for close pair sample than SDSS, can be a much better sample to study galaxy merger. The advantages of DESI also in the deeper image, which can even be used for statistically study the minor merger.

3. Magnetic field in local interacting galaxies

   > It is a idea come from the study of magnetized filaments in Galactic center, [Coughlin et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13790) have proposed that the tidal disruption may also play a role for the formation of the magnetic field. So it would be interesting to search the magnetic field in the tidal disrupted galaxies.

4. Molecular gas and dust properties in super-thin galaxies

   > Super-thin galaxies were though to have very cold stellar disk and rich in atomic gas. They are dominated by dark matter in all scales of the galaxy. 

## Rotational curve

Study how the rotational curve changed from Cusp to Core:

1. From Ultra Diffused Galaxy -> Ultra Compact Galaxy, study the compactness of the dark matter? 

2. Maybe a parameter to quantify the compactness of dark matter is essential?

3. The compactness of dark matter as a function of galaxy type, stellar mass, baryonic compactness, age, redshift

4. High redshift SMG? If the feedback have not affect the distribution of DM

   > It may need the evidence about how long the stellar feedback can affect the distribution of dark matter.

5. Proto-cluster, if the all the members gathered in one dark matter halo, is it possible to measure the rotational curve of the cluster by the cluster members?

   > It may not be a good idea, if the proto-cluster cannot be regarded as one fully thermalized system



6. Study the rotational curve of the disk galaxy at high-z, from gravitational lensing? 

   > They may underwent fewer feedback than local galaxies, which can preserve their cusp dark matter profile?

## IMBH

1. IMBH has a variability scale of hours. IFU opportunity to search for off-nuclear IMBH, search for manga repeat observation and test the possibility of china space 2.5meter telescope. 

## Cosmology

- If the core and cusp problem favour the interaction between dark matter and the baryons, will this effect have any signals in the BAO?



## Technicals

Differential phase difference:

1. ALMACAL searching for spectral lines in the unreolved blazer center, possibe place to search for gas motion using differential phase?

Power Spectra Distribution:

1. Anything related with SSP fitting? 

   



# PhD life



## Knowledge needed for PhD

1. Bayesian inference

   > - [ ] Systematically study the Baysian inference with a fixed plan
   >
   > Maybe one software to model the kinematics based on Bayesian inference?
   >
   > http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12023 can be a good reference.

2. SED fitting, CIGAL, MBB

3. Dust physics





# Questions

Questions to be questioned:

1. Why the interferometers has much accurate astrometry? Due to the phase calibrator?

   > Because the phase calibrator. The phase calibrator can have very accurate astrometry, in this case, we can also achieve very high accurate relative position to phase calibrator. As a result, we can achieve much higher position accurate for our science target.
