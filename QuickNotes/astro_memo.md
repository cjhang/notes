RR Lyrae stars: 



MIRI: emission lines at> 2700A fall in MIRI spectral coverage

Lyman break 8<z<11

Lya z>4

NIRSpec 3'x3'

NIRISS 2.2'x2'2'



EoR:

Nebular emiision in early universe should be careful when deriving the stellar mass and sfr





Foundations of Clustering

Clustering approchach

1. K-means, centroid based clustering
2. linkage method, hierarchical clustering
3. density based clustering, GMM, DBSCAN





CP & Howk ARAA 2020

Pepples+2019





GRAVITY+ for cosmic distance:

- Elipsing binaries, only in neighborhood of solar
- Cepheids, but only about 10 sources
- SN Ia, usable phase reference.
- AGN reverberation mapping, calibrated L-R relation

Grativity+ for SMBH

- independently check the single epoch measurements of SMBH mass in the high-z

X-ray --> Density view

SZ --> electron pressure View



Matthee+2019, upper limit for the dust content in LAEs. Maybe very young system

Matthee+2017 [C II] in LAEs, clumpy structures

Matthee+2021, higher Lya EW, the lower stellar metallicity



## Dynamics:

Solar system, 4.568 Gyr, 

Planets: e<=0.1, Mercury e=0.21, coplanar, < 1.9deg

Uranus have a almost penperdicular rings, 98deg tilt
